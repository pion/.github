# Security Policy

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security
vulnerabilities responsibly. The Pion organisation does not operate a bug
bounty program or offer monetary rewards for vulnerabilities, but we do
acknowledge individuals and organisations in our security bulletins.
 
We take all security vulnerabilities seriously, but as this project is entirely
volunteer driven we may not be able to respond to issues in as timely a manner
as we would like. We make a good faith effort to respond to reports within 72
hours.

If you would like to report a vulnerability in a component under the Pion
umbrella please email:
> security [at] pion [dot] ly
